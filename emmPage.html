            I first started coding in November 2019 and was trying to create
            <br>
            a movie streaming application without knowing what was really needed.
            <br>
            I then started to make fail projects that kept on failing or had to
            <br>
            be redone on a different place. This was all C# until the 25th October
            <br>
            2020 where the game ulo's Platform was created. It was my first C#
            <br>
            game and it was all functioning well and versions would be released
            <br> 
            of some time every three months. I wanted to then expand his programming
            <br>
            and not just use open sourced tutorials so I started to learn HTML 
            <br> 
            currently working on CSS and then JavaScript in the future. I
            <br>
            will fully learn C# and continue ulo's Platform. It's good to know
            <br>
            the three coding languages to webpages because it might be needed
            <br>
            soon in the game.
